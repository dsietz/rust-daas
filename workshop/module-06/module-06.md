## Module VI - Building a RESTful Endpoint for Publishing Reporting Data

In this module we will create a _Data Publishing_ RESTful service which will provide the reporting data as an API that a presentation layer (e.g.: Excel, PowerBI, Tablau, etc.) can call.

1. Declaring dependencies
2. Constructing the _processor_ module
3. Constructing the executable for the processing service
4. Testing the RESTful service
