### Section II

Just like the daas module, the **couchdb** module is an adaptive layer to facility the interaction between the library and the CouchDB database. 

Constructing the module will require us to make changes to the following files:

+ Cargo.toml (manifest)
+ src/lib.rs (library)
+ src/couchdb.rs (module)
