### Section I

Let's begin with the daas module. This module will provide us the ability to represent data in the context of DaaS with the easy of object management. Using an _object wrapper_ allows us to manage the data independently of its schema.

Constructing the module will require us to make changes to the following files:

+ Cargo.toml (manifest)
+ src/lib.rs (library)
+ src/daas.rs (module)
