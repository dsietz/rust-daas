# Wrap Up

Data has quickly become the most valuable commodity in IT. Like any commodity, management of the Data is routinely measured against its Risks, Rewards, and Volatility. 

#### Risks
+ Security
+ Data Privacy
+ Usability

#### Rewards
+ Return On Investment (ROI)
+ Last Responsible Moment (LRM)
+ On Time To Delivery

#### Volatility
+ Adaptability
+ Scalability
+ Availability

Adoption of the microservice architecture has flipped the way we look at data management and placed upon it a business lens for which we validate its success.
