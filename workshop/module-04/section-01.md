### Section I

In Module II, we build out a RESTful service that responded with "Hello World!" whenever a GET call was made to the service. The coding of this service was comprised of 3 basic parts.

1. Declarations of dependent, (e.g.: Crates.toml, `extern crate` and `use`)
2. Constructing the module, (e.g.: src/hello_world.rs)
3. Constructing the executable service, (e.g.: src/bin/hello-world.rs)

We will follow the same pattern for building out this RESTful service for sourcing data to our reporting system.
